title: Post Election Narrative - Dec. 10, 2020
---

A month after Biden's historic presidential victory, various media outlets and pundits have begun to push narratives about why Biden won and how he could have done better. Some argue that Biden's win was inevitable because of Trump's unconventional character, others argue that Biden would have performed better if he had proposed more liberal policies, and yet more say that Biden's high-tech campaign was essential to his victory. In this blog post I will be exploring one specific narrative, that Joe Biden won the election because of his appeals to working class white voters that voted for Trump in 2016. Some examples of this narrative in popular media include:

* The Atlantic
  * "He won because he was a reaction to Trump, but also because he was a white guy who could connect with white guys" - [Why Biden Won](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/why-biden-won-presidency/616980/) 

* Harvard Business Review
  * "Most importantly, Biden treated working-class whites with respect, which had been sorely lacking" - [How Biden Won Back (Enough of) the White Working Class](https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-biden-won-back-enough-of-the-white-working-class) 
  
* Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
  * "His goal was to draw in enough white working-class votes to win. Early returns show he did just that" - [Biden's blue-collar appeal brought in just enough white working-class votes to help him win Pa.](https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/11/11/Biden-s-rural-blue-collar-voters-gains-pennsylvania-election/stories/202011110110) 
  
## Testing the Narrative

If this narrative were true, that Biden was able to win the election because of his appeal to white voters, then we should see an increase in Democratic vote share in majority white counties between 2016 and 2020. Specifically, the increase in vote share for Biden over Clinton should be bigger in relatively white counties compared to relatively non-white counties. To test this theory, I will be looking at the change in democratic vote share by county and comparing it the percentage of white residents.
