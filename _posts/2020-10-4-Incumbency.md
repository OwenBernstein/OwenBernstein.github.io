title: Incumbency - October. 27, 2020
---

One key aspect of elections, especially presidential elections, are the advantages afforded to the incumbent. Presidential incumbents are more nationally recognized, receive more press coverage, and have the power to allocate federal funds. In fact, in their 2012 paper “The Influence of Federal Spending on Presidential Elections,” Douglas Kriner and Andrew Reeves find that an increase in federal spending increases the incumbent's vote share at the state level. In this post, I will examine the effects of incumbency, determine if these effects apply to Donald Trump, and develop a new national vote share model.
