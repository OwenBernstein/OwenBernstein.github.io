title: Advertising - Oct. 5, 2020
---

In this week's blog post I will examine the most public facing aspect of an election, the campaigns themselves. One factor of a campaign that voters interact with frequently is advertisements. Politicians and their parties care immensely about advertisements, going so far as to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising each election cycle. In this blog I will explore **if campaign spending can be used to predict election outcomes, what the best time to spend money on ads is, and then use campaign advertising in a model to predict the 2020 election outcome.** 

## Advertisement Spending

In every presidential election from 2000 to 2004 both parties spent large sums of money on advertising. This spending varied drastically by state and time, giving some clue that **campaigns strategically invest in advertisements.** Research from Alan Gerber and Gregory Huber confirms this prediction and gives evidence that **political advertising can in fact have a persuasive effect on voters.** Knowing this, I will explore how much campaigns have been spending

From these graphs it is clear that campaigns tend to spend more as the election gets closer. **Spending in October appears to be significantly higher than earlier months.**
