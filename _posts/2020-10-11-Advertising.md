title: Advertising - Oct. 5, 2020
---

In this week's blog post I will examine the most public facing aspect of an election, the campaigns themselves. One factor of a campaign that voters interact with frequently is advertisements. In 2016, each party spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising. I will explore how effective that campaign spending (and other campaign's) was, what the best time to spend money on ads is, and then examine campaign advertising in 2020.
